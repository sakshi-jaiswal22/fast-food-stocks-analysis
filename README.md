# Overview
This project analyzes stock market data for the top 10 fast food giants, offering insights into their financial performance, trading activities, and market trends. The dashboard is designed using Power BI, with data preprocessed and stored in MySQL for efficient handling and visualization.

# Key Features
- Daily Returns and Volume Analysis: Visualizes company-wise performance and trading activity.
- Stock Price Patterns: Tracks trends with 30-day moving averages.
- Relative Strength Index (RSI): Identifies overbought and oversold conditions.
- Dynamic Filters: Customize analysis by company, year, month, and quarter.
  
# Project Steps
## 1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and handled missing values, anomalies, and outliers.
Engineered features such as daily returns, moving averages, RSI, and log returns.
Combined individual company datasets into a single master table for seamless analysis.
## 2. SQL Database Setup
Stored the processed data in a MySQL database.
Included a schema with relevant fields such as Date, Company_Name, Close_Price, Volume, and calculated features.
Ensured the database was optimized for large-scale queries.
## 3. Power BI Integration
Imported data from the SQL database into Power BI.
Designed a user-friendly dashboard with intuitive visuals and interactivity.
Incorporated slicers and filters to allow users to explore data dynamically.
